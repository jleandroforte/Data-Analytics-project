# Data-Analytics-project
Final work for Coderhouse's Data Analytics project. 

The project is an analysis of the socieconomic structure of Argentina based on its main household survey, Encuesta Permanente de Hogares (EPH) in Power BI. 

By this analysis, we set out to characterize the demographic characteristics, the level and sources of income and an exploration on inequalities on the regional level and by gender. 

The main project consists in the Power BI dashboard (Entrega Final - Data Analytics - Leandro Forte.pbix) and the acompanying documentation and explanations (PDF file Documentaci√≥n Entrega Final - Leandro Forte)
